# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of my **1-Month Internship** in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.  
It focuses on building an intelligent system that predicts **whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant** using **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** concepts.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide.  
Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.  
This project demonstrates how **AI and ML models** can be applied to predict breast cancer at an early stage using medical data.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** – for ML model training  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for visualization  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for Deep Learning  
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex** – for RAG-based chatbot  
- **Streamlit** – for interactive web app

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic))  
It contains 569 records with 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of breast masses.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gathered dataset from UCI repository  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned and normalized data  
3. **Feature Selection** – Chose relevant features for better accuracy  
4. **Model Training** – Used algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Tested using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve  
6. **Deployment** – Built a Streamlit interface for real-time predictions

## 🧩 Deep Learning and RAG Extensions
- Built a **CNN model** to experiment with image classification tasks.  
- Explored **RNN/LSTM** for sequence-based data.  
- Implemented a **RAG-based chatbot** that retrieves answers from documents using **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**, connecting LLMs with factual context.
